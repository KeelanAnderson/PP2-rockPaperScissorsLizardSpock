# rockPaperScissorsLizardSpock

rockPaperScissorsLizardSpock is a game of chance played against the computer. The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found. The player will enter a game of best of five against the computer so the first to win 3 rounds will be crowned the winner. The game is aimed at people of all ages and can be used by all to make decisions, settle disputes or just have some fun online. Statistically speaking its been proven that in the game of rock, paper, scissors, players who know each other are more likely to draw. This game expands the outcomes to make it more challenging and since its played against the computer, the computer choice is completely random so the outcomes end in a fairer result.

## Features
### Existing Features

#### Heading
the rockPaperScissorsLizardSpock game heading is featured at the top of the page and is written in camelcase style as this is a javascript project.

#### Menu

the menu is the first page users will see when opening the site. The menu has 2 buttons. It is very simplistic and is made this way for easy navigation through the site. the first button is labelled 'best of five' and will bring the user straight into the game. The second button is labelled rules and will bring the user to a page explaining all the rules of the game. when hovered over the buttons will get slighted larger and the pointer cursor will appear making it obvious to the user that they are clickable buttons.

#### Rules

The rules page contains a paragraph explaining what the game is, a diagram displaying all the different outcomes and a list of each outcome.

There is an x icon in the top right corner of the page that when clicked will navigate the user back to the menu. At the end of the page there is another clickable link back to the menu clearly labelled 'go back to menu'. the reason i have added a second link to the menu page is that in the case that the user has scrolled the the bottom of the page they will no long see the button in the top right corner and upon finishing reading the rules they will have the instant option to go back to the menu to get into the game as quickly as possible.

#### Game
##### Controls Area
The Controls Area consists of 5 buttons with the name of each choice inside. Once clicked the round will begin and the players choice will be dislpayed on the left hand side of the screen. It has the heading controls so the user knows to what the buttons are for. When hovered over the buttons will get slighted larger and the pointer cursor will appear making it obvious to the user that they are clickable buttons.

##### Choice display

Once the player made there choice the computer choice will be displayed at ther same and the winner will be revealed. the player choice is displayed on the left and the computer choice is displayed on the right. This is clearly labelled to avoid confusion for the user. inside the choice display is an image of the outcome chosen by both the player and the computer.

##### Result Display

just underneath the choice display the result display will pop up once the round has finished saying either 'you win' or 'you lose'. the result is only displayed after a choice as been made to keep the game page clear and simple.

##### Score

the score is displayed directly under the choice display for both sides. Whoever wins the round their score will increment by 1. the first to win 3 rounds will be crowned the overall winner.

##### Exit Game

In the bottom right corner is an option the exit the game if the user wishes to leave the game early. if this button is clicked the game will be over and the user will be returned to the menu page and no overall winner will be chosen. when hovered over the link will have the pointer cursor.

#### Features Left To Implement

some features I would like to implement to the game would be a larger variety of game modes. I would also like a implement of feature where players could enter a username and be listed on a high scores page.

some other features i would also like to implement is if the images displayed showed to outcome in an animation. for example if player chose rock and computer chose scissors in the animation the scissors would cut the paper.

- I also tested my website on my Iphone, Ipad and Computer and was happy with the outcome on each device.

- I used the web developer tools consistenly to ensure my website was responsive at mobile screen sizes and then at larger screen sizes. I used the device feature of dev tools to test my website on all devices available.

- I tried to commit my changes as much as possible. Like the testing I did this throughout the project to ensure I had lots of versions, and I could go back to a previous version should a major error occur.

### Validator Testing

### Unfixed Bugs

## Deployment

This site was deployed to GitHub pages.

I created my Repository on Github and coded the entire project on Gitpod. VSCode is my text editor. It has a built in terminal so I could do everything I needed in one place. GitHub is where my repository is held externally. I deployed the site to Github Pages from Github in the repository settings where I set the branch to main and saved it. I then refreshed the page and a detailed ribbon was displayed saying my site was successfully deployed.
